- Powershell 7.1 - Conway's Game of Life

- This project is an exercise in learning powershell as a programming language, and showing off conway's game of life in one pattern(seed) to anyone interested. This is attached to my linked in and resume, please feel free to reach out with questions, comments, or suggestions - I am always looking for ways to improve!

- This code simulates one stable seed, meaning the group will never die off/will continue infinitely. If you've never seen the concept, check out the wiki article - it's pretty cool! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
